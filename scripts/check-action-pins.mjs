/**
 * Reports GitHub Actions SHA pins that have drifted from the tag they claim.
 *
 * Dependabot used to own refreshing these pins; scheduled automation
 * (Dependabot included) is banned repo-wide (issue #98), so this check is the
 * mechanism instead. Run it via the `Action Pin Freshness` workflow_dispatch
 * job in security.yml, or locally:
 *
 *   npm run security:action-pins
 *
 * Exit code 1 when either:
 *
 *   - a pin is stale — the tag has moved since it was pinned, which usually
 *     means upstream shipped a fix this repository is frozen against; or
 *   - a pin that carries both a SHA and a `# <tag>` comment could not be
 *     resolved. The comparison was owed and did not happen. Without this, a
 *     rate-limited or unauthorised run resolves nothing, reports every
 *     reference as unknown and exits 0 — indistinguishable by exit code from
 *     a clean run, which is the all-clear CI acts on (#140).
 *
 * References with nothing to compare against — no SHA, a SHA with no
 * `# <tag>` comment, or a deliberate `# <branch> @ <date>` branch pin like
 * Dependency-Check_Action's — are reported as unknown and do not fail the
 * run. Nothing was missed in those cases; there was never anything to check.
 *
 * Env vars:
 *   GITHUB_TOKEN   — raises the API rate limit from 60/hr to 5000/hr. Optional
 *                    locally; supplied automatically in Actions.
 *   GITHUB_API_URL — the REST API origin. Actions sets it (and it is what
 *                    makes GitHub Enterprise work); the exit-code tests point
 *                    it at a stub server. Defaults to https://api.github.com.
